# CS319-Group24
The project for CS319 Bilkent University

Our project is a game named “Saving Humanity”. It is played from a top-down perspective and its maps are in form of maze.We have influenced from the old game called "Tank 1990" aka "Battle City". In this game the world has been invaded by aliens with their tanks and the only hope is you with your tank. Your mission is to kill all of the aliens and save the humanity. You will encounter different types of enemies and they will become stronger as you kill them. There are various powerups and bad powerups which are dropped by dead enemies. Also you can play it with your friends from the same keyboard. Once you finish all the leveles, you will be the savior of the world.
